## üß† Model Overview

The model used here is a **multi-class classifier** trained on labeled product reviews. It combines **TF-IDF vectorization** with **Logistic Regression** for final sentiment classification.

This setup was chosen due to Logistic Regression's efficiency and interpretability, making it a strong baseline for text classification tasks.

Prediction Labels:
- `0` ‚Üí Negative
- `1` ‚Üí Neutral
- `2` ‚Üí Positive

## üìä Dataset

> This dataset contains information about Product name, Product price, Rate, Reviews, Summary and Sentiment in csv format. There are 104 different types of products of flipkart.com such as electronics items, clothing of men, women and kids, Home decor items, Automated systems, so on. It has 205053 rows and 6 columns. Also, if any product doesn't have any review but summary is present then Nan value already added to its blank space.

This dataset has multiclass label as sentiment such as positive, neutral amd negative.The sentiment given was based on column called Summary using NLP and Vader model. Also, after that we manually check the label and put it into the appropriate categories like if summary has text like okay, just ok or one positive and negative we labeled as neutral for better understanding while using this dataset for human languages. On the summary and price column, data cleaning method is already performed using python module called NumPy and Pandas which are famous.You can learn it also through any online resource.
